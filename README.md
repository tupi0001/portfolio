During the development of my final HTML project, one of the main challenges I encountered was website navigation. Initially, I struggled with the positioning of navigation elements as I attempted to configure proper padding and alignment. Initially, I had set certain padding values, but later had to adjust them to achieve the desired visual appearance and layout.

Working on the contact page proved to be particularly challenging. Here, I had to meticulously fine-tune the contact form, align elements, and ensure that all components looked and functioned correctly. It required a significant amount of time and effort to achieve the desired result, but ultimately, it proved to be a valuable and enlightening experience.

Overall, the layout wasn't that complicated, but I spent hours fine-tuning some details.
